# Opinionated configurable GitHub Actions Workflows

These are my personal opinionated configurable GitHub Actions Workflows, aimed at my personal needs to be the single 
central point of all my GitHub Actions Workflows. Over the years most of my workflows started from one or two and 
diverged in all directions, this repository is to reel that all back in one easy to maintain them for all my 
repositories.

## Opinionated choices

### Runs On

Each workflow, well most of them, take two runs-on arguments `runsOnChaos` and `runsOnOrder`. As the names suggest 
`runsOnChaos` runs as many jobs at the same time as possible where `runsOnOrder` runs them one by one. For most 
jobs `runsOnChaos` is fine, but for things like `TerraForm` apply, and `Helm` install where state somewhere is 
changed and only one can run at the same time `runsOnOrder` is the way to go. Mainly came to this while working on 
getting the workflows managing my home cluster to work as intended:

![Home Cluster](./images/home-cluster.jpg)

When not set they all default to `ubuntu-latest` which means it will run on GitHub provided Runners.

### Makefile

All the quality control checks for the CI entry point are handled and controlled through Makefiles this gives each
project the control to check and assert everything relevant to it. When creating the task matrix the repositories the
Makefile is expected to have a `task-list-ci` command which will output a JSON array of tasks.

### Sparse Checkout

Sparse checkout is used as much as possible to keep job run times as long as possible. Several of my projects have
1GB+ binary test data checked in, this takes some time to checkout, maybe even more so on Raspberry Pis. By
aggressively using the `sparse-checkout` checkout option [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout/)
provides checkout times plummeted. For the biggest repo this went down to 4 seconds from 66 seconds without sparse
checkout. This resulted in a few inputs being such as `ociSparseCheckout`, `helmSparseCheckout`, and
`terraformSparseCheckout`. Each of those 3 is used with `sparse-checkout-cone-mode: false` meaning that you can use
patterns like the following in there:
```yaml
sparseCheckout: |
  !/*
  /.terraform/*
  /**/*.md
  /composer.json
  /composer.lock
```

Also since those are free form fields you're expected to put in `workingDirectory` and `terraformDirectory` your self.
For example in the case of `TerraForm` the full checkout step is:

```yaml
 - uses: actions/checkout@v4
   with:
     sparse-checkout-cone-mode: false
     sparse-checkout: |
       !{{ "${{ inputs.workingDirectory }}" }}/*
       /{{ "${{ inputs.workingDirectory }}" }}{{ "${{ inputs.terraformDirectory }}" }}*
       {{ "${{ inputs.terraformSparseCheckout }}" }}
```

### Versioning

Everything going through the package endpoints assumes [`Semantic Versioning`](https://semver.org/), and has
automation to automatically decide what the appropriate version bump is. Projects use monotonically increasing release
version, `r1`, `r2`, `r13`, `r66` etc etc.

### OCI images

All images are pushing to GitHub's container registry at `ghcr.io` with the full repository name as image name taken
from `{{ "${{ github.repository }}" }}`. On each build image image tag will be `sha-COMMIT_SHA` where `COMMIT_SHA` is
taken from `{{ "${{ github.sha }}" }}`.

Release images are tagged with the passed milestone title as the image tag.

## Entry points

There are to types of entry points supported. `Package` and `project`, the former is meant for 
PHP packages/GitHub Actions/Anything-that-is-not-a-project while the latter is for websites/services.

### Release Management

Each type has two entry points. The first being `Release Management`, which takes care of everything related to 
releasing new versions and all the information and bits required for that. This includes:

* Required labels
* Package Manager/Helm/TerraForm Diff
* OCI image retaging
* Helm deploy to Kubernetes
* Setting a milestone on PR's
* Creating a GitHub release
* Generating a changelog
* Push static content to a CDN

It should be triggered for the following events:

* Closing of a milestone
* PR's for the follow types: `opened`, `labeled`, `unlabeled`, `synchronize`, `reopened`, `milestoned`, `demilestoned`, and `ready_for_review`.

#### CI

The other entry point is `CI` it does everything related to validating the current push of the code meets expectations
through a series of [`Makefile`](#Makefile) commands. When present CI will also build the OCI (Docker) image if
present. Any control over the different platforms the OCI image is released for is done here, the release management
doing any retagging will detect which platforms are in the image it retags and uses those without the need to
configure them.

## What's included

And how to configure it.

### CI

The CI entry point only takes two configuration inputs `env` and `services`, both take a JSON string as argument.
For example adding the Redis DSN to the environment is written as:

```yaml
with:
  env: "{\"REDIS_DSN\":\"redis://redis:6379/6\"}"
```

While the service providing redis is written as:

```yaml
with:
  services: "{\"redis\":{\"image\":\"redis\",\"options\":\"--health-cmd \\\"redis-cli ping\\\" --health-interval 1s --health-timeout 5s --health-retries 50\"}}"
```

### Docker/OCI

The OCI image building and retagging responsibilities using Docker are split between the CI and Release Management
entry points. CI builds the images and decides what goes into them and for what platform, while Release Management
purely retags the images build by CI.

CI will only build images if you provide the `Dockerfile` you're using through the `dockerfile` input. Provide
`dockerBuildTarget` when using a multi-stage Docker file to build the desired target. Any additional arguments can be
passed to the Docker build command using `dockerBuildExtraArguments`.

By default the OCI build workflow will detect all the platforms the first upstream image found in `FROM` is build for
and build the image for the same platforms. If you want to override that pass an `CSV` of different platforms to the
`ociPlatforms` in put in this format: `linux/amd64,linux/arm`.

To speed up checking out during building `ociSparseCheckout` can be used to exclude any files we don't care about and
will slowdown our checkout. For example in one of my projects the `tests/data/` directory contains 1GB+ binary data
for testing, I have zero need to check that out during image build. So my sparse checkout allows everything but any
file from `tests/data/`:

```yaml
ociSparseCheckout: |
  /*
  !/tests/data/*
```

To kick off retagging simple set `ociRetag` to `true` on the Release Management entry point.

### Helm

When the `helmDirectory` is passed to the release management entry point isn't an empty string both the
Helm Diff and Helm Deploy workflows are executed against that directory.

As with any Helm chart being deployed we need to give it a name, the `helmReleaseName` is used to specify that.

By default a sparse checkout is performed and only the passed `helmDirectory` is checked out, if you need than
that you can use `helmSparseCheckout` with additional patterns to check out.

To set additional values or to overwrite existing values from `values.yaml` `helmAdditionalArguments` can be used to
pass any additional args to the diff and upgrade commands. For example  to get dynamically generated values from
another job:

```yaml
name: Release Management
on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - opened
      - labeled
      - unlabeled
      - synchronize
      - reopened
  milestone:
    types:
      - closed
permissions:
  contents: write
  issues: write
  pull-requests: write
  packages: write
jobs:
  helm-json:
    name: Generate JSON for Helm
    runs-on: chaos
    outputs:
      helm-json: {{ "${{ steps.helm-json.outputs.helm-json }}" }}
    steps:
      - run: printf "helm-json=%s" $(echo "{\"LOGLEVEL\":\"DEBUG\"}") >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
  release-management:
    name: Release Management
    needs:
      - helm-json
    secrets: inherit
    uses: WyriHaximus/github-workflows/.github/workflows/project-release-management.yaml@main
    with:
      helmAdditionalArguments: --set-json='application={{ "${{ needs.helm-json.outputs.helm-json }}" }}'
```

Because these workflows provide diff comments on PR's for Helm and others we need to specify `helmReleaseValueName` so
we can assign the previous tag on diff and closed milestone on deploy to that value. We can't use `helmAdditionalArguments` for this as we
autodetect the previous tag. Similarly `helmUpdateAppVersion` is used to update the `appVersion` in `Chart.yaml`,
when set to `true`, with the same value in those two scenarios.

### Linting

A few, maybe somewhat random, linters are included in the work flows. One of them checks if links in markdown
resources are responding with a ~200 status code and errors when they are no longer working.

### TerraForm

When the `terraformDirectory` is passed to the release management entry point isn't an empty string both the
TerraForm Diff and TerraForm Apply workflows are executed against that directory. The repository is expecting to have
the following secrets for TerraForm state storage on S3:

* `TERRAFORM_STATE_KEY`
* `TERRAFORM_STATE_SECRET`
* `TERRAFORM_STATE_BUCKET`
* `TERRAFORM_STATE_REGION`

By default a sparse checkout is performed and only the passed `terraformDirectory` is checked out, if you need than
that you can use `terraformSparseCheckout` with additional patterns to check out. Further more `terraformParallelism`
and `terraformLogLevel` can be used to tune TerraForm's behavior.

In order to inject variables into TerraForm `terraformVars` is used to create `terraform.tfvars` in
the `terraformDirectory`. Variables can be hard coded but secrets are available as environment variables:

```yaml
terraformVars: |
  kubernetes_config_path   = "~/.kube/config"
  kubernetes_context       = "$HOME_KUBE_CONTEXT"
  kubernetes_namespace     = "$HOME_KUBE_NAMESPACE"
```
